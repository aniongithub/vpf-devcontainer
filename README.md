# vpf-devcontainer

A [Devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)-ready template repository for NVIDIA's [Video Processing Framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA/VideoProcessingFramework)

All you need to do is create a new repo based on this template (or clone it), download the [Nvidia Video Codec SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-video-codec-sdk/download) into `CodecSDK/` and use the VS Code command palette to `Build and open in container`. When the container finishes building, you can hit F5 to run the `decoder.py` example or begin your own development from there!
